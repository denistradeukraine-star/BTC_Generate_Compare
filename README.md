# BTC_Generate_Compare - the best BTC adress generating and comparing scrypt

Summary of btc_pattern_scanner.py

Purpose:
Generates Bitcoin private keys following specified patterns (from patterns.txt), derives multiple address types (P2PKH, P2SH, SegWit, Taproot), and checks if they exist in a large address database (Parquet → LMDB).
If a match is found, the script records it with the private key and WIF formats.

Pattern Types Supported (from patterns.txt):

octal → 8 hex characters, each repeated 8×

sequence_4x16 → 4-symbol sequence repeated 16×

Modes:

Pattern Mode: Generate private keys from user-defined patterns.

Sequential Mode: Start from a specific/random/last-saved key and iterate sequentially.

Performance Features:

Uses multiprocessing with configurable workers (workers_gen, workers_db).

LMDB used as fast key-value database for address lookups (loaded from Parquet).

Chunked processing of patterns to avoid memory issues.

Resume/Checkpoint files (processed_patterns.txt, last_state.json, last_sequential_key.txt) for crash recovery.

Monitoring thread displays throughput, memory, CPU usage, and matches in real-time.

Writes results incrementally to matches.csv and a final summary.

how to install:

Perfect! Here’s a **single-line copy-paste command** for Linux. Just paste it into your terminal and it will do everything:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-venv python3-pip build-essential libsecp256k1-dev && python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install --upgrade pip && pip install ecdsa base58 bech32 tqdm lmdb pandas coincurve psutil pyarrow && echo "Setup complete! Virtual environment 'venv' is activated. Run your script with: python btc_pattern_scanner.py"
```

---

✅ **What it does:**

1. Updates your system and installs required system packages.
2. Creates a Python virtual environment called `venv`.
3. Activates the virtual environment.
4. Upgrades `pip`.
5. Installs **all Python dependencies** directly.
6. Prints a message telling you how to run the script.

After pasting this, you’ll be ready to run:

```bash
python btc_pattern_scanner.py
```

Do you want me to also make a **one-line version that works even if the venv already exists**?
